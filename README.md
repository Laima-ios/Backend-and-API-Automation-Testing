Automated test cases, for different scenarios 
API Automation Tests
This repository contains automated API tests for a User Account API. The tests cover CRUD operations for managing user accounts and ensure proper functionality and edge cases are handled correctly.

Prerequisites
To set up and run the tests, you need the following installed:

PHP 7.4+ (Ensure PHP is installed and available on your system)

Composer (Dependency manager for PHP)

Codeception (For running API tests)

Setting Up the Environment
Follow the steps below to set up your local environment:

1. Install PHP
Make sure PHP is installed on your system.

For Windows, download PHP from the official site: https://windows.php.net/download

For macOS, install PHP using Homebrew:

bash

brew install php
For Ubuntu/Linux, install PHP with the following commands:

bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install php php-cli php-mbstring php-xml php-curl
You can verify the installation by running:

bash

php -v
2. Install Composer
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. If you don’t have it installed, follow these instructions:

Download Composer from https://getcomposer.org/download/

On Linux/macOS, use the command:

bash

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
On Windows, download the Composer Setup executable.

Verify that Composer is installed by running:

bash

composer -v
3. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-api-tests.git
cd my-api-tests
4. Install Dependencies
Use Composer to install all required dependencies for Codeception:

bash

composer install
This will install Codeception and other dependencies listed in composer.json.

Running the Tests
Once the environment is set up, you can run the automated tests.

1. Run All Tests
To run all tests in the api directory, execute the following command:

bash

vendor/bin/codecept run api
This will run all API tests and display the results in the terminal.

2. Run Specific Test
If you want to run a specific test (e.g., testing user creation), you can do so by specifying the test file:

bash

vendor/bin/codecept run api UserCest:testCreateUser
This will run the testCreateUser function inside the UserCest.php file.

Test Scenarios
The following test scenarios are covered:

Create User: Test successful creation of a user.

Get User by ID: Retrieve an existing user by ID.

Invalid User Creation: Handle invalid input (e.g., missing required fields).

Update User: Update user details and verify the changes.

Delete User: Delete an existing user and ensure it’s no longer retrievable.

Edge Cases: Handle cases like trying to retrieve, update, or delete a non-existing user.

Configuration
The Codeception tests are configured to use the REST module for interacting with the API. The codeception.yml file is configured to use the API server running at http://localhost:8080/api.

If your API is hosted on a different URL or port, update the url field in the codeception.yml file:

yaml

modules:
  enabled:
    - REST:
        url: 'http://localhost:8080/api'  # Change this to your API base URL
        depends: PhpBrowser
    - Asserts
Additional Features (Optional)
Performance Testing: You can implement performance tests with Gatling or JMeter to measure API response times.

Security Testing: Tests for unauthorized access are included (e.g., checking if API endpoints reject requests without authentication).

Data-Driven Tests: You can extend the tests with data-driven approaches to validate multiple input combinations using Codeception’s data providers.

Containerization: If you want to containerize the setup, you can use Docker to create an isolated environment for your API and tests.

3. Important Considerations
API URL: Make sure to update the url in the codeception.yml file if your API is running on a different host or port.

Environment Variables: If your tests require authentication or any other environment variables, include instructions for setting them in the README.md.

Running the API Locally: Ensure that the API is running on http://localhost:8080/api (or another port if you specify) before running the tests.

Custom Configurations: If your project has any special setup (e.g., using Docker), include instructions on how to run the API within containers (e.g., using docker-compose).
